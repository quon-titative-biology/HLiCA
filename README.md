# Human Liver Atlas for CZI

This is code repository for integrative analysis of Human Liver Atlas project. We jointly examine human liver datasets from multiple labs to leverage the diversity across multiple populations.


The analysis contains multiple set of analysis as shown below
* Data management
* Metadata curation → harmonized metadata
* Quality control
* Data integration
* Cell annotation → harmonized cell annotation
* Gradient annotation
* Covariate analysis
* Disease integration

## Data management
This contains pipeline for collecting dataset from multiple sources then uniformly processing them through cell ranger in order to remove potential technical variation occurring from processing pipeline.

## Metadata curation → harmonized metadata

## Quality control

## Data integration

## Cell annotation → harmonized cell annotation

## Gradient annotation

## Covariate analysis

## Disease integration
